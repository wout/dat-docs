# DAT examples

In December 2022, the initial version of the DAT Metadata Standard was released, and it has recently been transformed into a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal).

## The Perfect NFT

February 2023, [MICK+WOUT](https://mick-wout.com/) and [Alexander Watanabe](https://twitter.com/monad_alexander/) collaborated on [The Perfect NFT](https://theperfectnft.art/), the first use of the DAT Metadata Standard. It was a blockchain art performance where collectors became participants by, quite literally, leaving their fingerprints on the pieces.

The first part of the collection was called _Temporal Bidding Declarations_, a series of receipts serving as proof of participation. In total, 3409 TBDs were minted.

The actual pieces were minted after the performance. Each composition is derived from a number between 0 and 511, representing a binary value.

Both collections are made up of a _scene_ token, a _renderer_ token, an SVG library, and fonts, all stored on the blockchain using DATs.
