# Specification

A single DAT is distributed over at least two tokens, represented by three possible token types: _scene_, _renderer_ and optionally, _dependency_.

Typically, _scene_ tokens don't hold any code. They carry a reference to the _renderer_ token, arguments for invocation of the _renderer_ and token-specific properties. _Scene_ tokens are therefore relatively small (less than 3kB). All _scene_ tokens in a collection reference one, or at most a few, _renderer_ tokens.

The code to render all _scene_ tokens is stored in a _renderer_ token, which in turn can reference _dependency_ tokens containing shared libraries or assets. _Dependency_ tokens are considered extensions to the _renderer_ and can not be referenced directly by _scene_ tokens.

::: info
The DAT Metadata Standard builds on the existing [CIP-0025](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0025) standard.
:::

## **1**. Scene

The _scene_ token is the part the end user will receive in their wallet. It contains all the information to render the DAT.

### **1.a.** Metadata

_Scene_ tokens require a `renderer` property to be present, referencing the token containing the code of the renderer.

Although not mandatory, it's advisable to bundle token-specific properties in the `properties` object to avoid pollution of the token's root namespace. It will help token viewers locate and render those details.

```json{15,19-22,24-26}
{
  "721": {
    "<policy_id>": {
      "<asset_name>": {
        "name": <string>,
        "description": <string>,

        "image": <uri | array>,
        "mediaType": image/<mime_sub_type>,

        "files": [{
          "name": <string>,
          "mediaType": <mime_type>,
          "src": <uri | array>,
          "license": <string>,
          <other_properties>
        }],

        "renderer": {
          "main": <asset_name>,
          "arguments": <array>
        },

        "properties": {
          <properties>
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Properties for the _scene_ token:

- **`renderer`** (_required_): an object with two properties
  - **`main`** (_required_): the `asset_name` of the _renderer_ token within the
    current `policy_id` (e.g. `my_renderer`)
  - **`arguments`** (_required_): an array with arbitrary values used as
    arguments for the invocation of the _renderer_ (e.g.: `[123]`)
- **`properties`** (_optional_): an object with arbitrary key/value pairs describing the token's (unique) properties

::: details
If a DAT uses data from the blockchain to drive its generative algorithm, it's impossible to create a representational preview image before the mint. In that case, the preview image for wallets and marketplaces should be treated more as an album cover than a visual representation of the actual artifact.
:::

### **1.b.** Argument directives

Several directives for dynamic arguments can be passed to the renderer. Before rendering a DAT, viewers must resolve any directives by querying the requested data from the blockchain and passing the actual values to the renderer.

_Current token_

- **`@tx_hash`** (`string`): transaction hash of the mint (can for example, be used as the seed value for a Sfc32 PRNG)
- **`@epoch`** (`number`): epoch in which the token was minted
- **`@slot`** (`number`): slot in which the token was minted
- **`@block`** (`number`): block in which the token was minted
- **`@block_size`** (`number`): the size of the token's block
- **`@block_hash`** (`string`): hash of the token's block
- **`@owner_addresses`** (`string[]`): an array of owner addresses

_Previously minted token_

- **`@tx_hash.previous`** (`string | null`): transaction hash
- **`@epoch.previous`** (`number | null`): epoch in which the token was minted
- **`@slot.previous`** (`number | null`): slot in which the token was minted
- **`@block.previous`** (`number | null`): block in which the token was minted
- **`@block_size.previous`** (`number | null`): the size of the token's block
- **`@block_hash.previous`** (`string | null`): hash of the token's block
- **`@arguments.previous`** (`array | null`): token's _renderer_ arguments

_Specific token (within the same policy_id)_

- **`@tx_hash.asset_name`** (`string | null`): transaction hash
- **`@epoch.asset_name`** (`number | null`): epoch in which the token was minted
- **`@slot.asset_name`** (`number | null`): slot in which the token was minted
- **`@block.asset_name`** (`number | null`): block in which the token was minted
- **`@block_size.asset_name`** (`number | null`): the size of the token's block
- **`@block_hash.asset_name`** (`string | null`): hash of the token's block
- **`@arguments.asset_name`** (`array | null`): token's _renderer_ arguments

_Current blockchain state_

- **`@current_epoch`** (`number`): current (latest) epoch
- **`@current_slot`** (`number`): current (latest) slot
- **`@current_block`** (`number`): current (latest) minted block
- **`@current_block_size`** (`number`): the size of the current block
- **`@current_block_hash`** (`string`): hash of the current block

Passing argument directives to the _renderer_ works just like static arguments. For example:

```json
[
  123,
  "@tx_hash",
  "@block",
  "@current_block",
  "@epoch.previous",
  "@arguments.the_perfect_nft_000"
]
```

::: warning
Referencing another token's arguments does not work recursively.
:::

::: info
The list of directives mentioned above is not final. Proposals for new directives will be considered and added over time.
:::

## **2**. Renderer

The _renderer_ token is at the heart of a DAT collection and can either be a self-contained program or one with dependencies. It is always part of the same `policy_id` as the _scene_ tokens. Multiple _renderer_ tokens can exist within a policy, but _scene_ tokens can only reference one _renderer_ at a time.

### **2.a.** Metadata

The _renderer_'s code is stored in the `files` property as-is or as a base64-encoded string. The `name` property of the file must match the `asset_name` with the appropriate file extension, so viewers can filter out the renderer-related files.

A _renderer_ must always define an `outputType`. Token viewers decide which output types to support.

::: info
A single _renderer_ token can have multiple files of different mime types, as long as the file names match the token's `asset_name`.
:::

```json{9,13,15-18,20-22}
{
  "721": {
    "<policy_id>": {
      "<asset_name>": {
        "files": [{
          "name": <asset_name>.<extension>,
          "mediaType": <mime_type>,
          "src": <uri | array>,
          "license": <string>,
          <other_properties>
        }],

        "outputType": <mime_type>,

        "dependencies": [{
          "type": <string>,
          <other_properties>
        }],

        "browsers": {
          <browser_name>: <major_version>
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Properties for the _renderer_ token:

- **`outputType`** (_required_): the mime type of the renderer's output (it's up to the viewer to define the supported formats)
- **`dependencies`** (_optional_): an array of objects with dependency definitions
- **`browsers`** (_required for browser-based DATs_): an object with versions of browsers against which the _renderer_ is tested

::: info
While not mandatory, adding a **`license`** property to every file in the `files` section is advisableâ€”more info on licenses is below in section 2.f.
:::

::: tip
The _renderer_ token should be burned after minting to free up the UTxO.
:::

::: warning
Token viewers may choose to limit the number of renderers per `policy_id`.
:::

### **2.b.** On-chain dependencies

These are policy-specific on-chain dependencies managed by the creator. They must be minted within the same `policy_id` and are referenced by their `asset_name`.

```json
{
  "type": "onchain",
  "asset_name": <asset_name>
}
```

- **`type`** (_required_): dependency type
- **`asset_name`** (_required_): name of the asset within the same policy

### **2.c.** Internal dependencies:

These are on-chain dependencies managed internally by the viewer and made available to the _renderer_ at runtime.

They can be referenced by using the dependency's asset `fingerprint`:

```json
{
  "type": "internal",
  "fingerprint": <asset_fingerprint>
}
```

- **`type`** (_required_): dependency type
- **`fingerprint`** (_required_): asset fingerprint

Alternatively, the asset's `policy_id` and `asset_name` can be used:

```json
{
  "type": "internal",
  "policy_id": <policy_id>,
  "asset_name": <asset_name>
}
```

- **`type`** (_required_): dependency type
- **`asset_name`** (_required_): name of the asset
- **`policy_id`** (_required_): policy id of the asset

::: tip
Using the `fingerprint` is more concise but doesn't tell anything about the referenced asset. Although more verbose, the second option is more readable thanks to the human-readable `asset_name`.
:::

### **2.d.** External dependencies:

These are off-chain dependencies managed by the viewer and made available to the _renderer_ at runtime.

```json
{
  "type": "external",
  "name": <library_name>,
  "version": <version_number>,
  "source": <uri>,
  "module": <boolean>
}
```

- **`type`** (_required_): dependency type
- **`name`** (_required_): name of the library (list provided by viewers)
- **`version`** (_required_): version of the library
- **`source`** (_required_): URI of the library (IPFS, Arweave, etc.)
- **`module`** (_required_): module flag; if set to `false`, an iife variant is used

::: details
The _external_ dependency definitions are not referencing any token on the blockchain, unlike the _onchain_ and _internal_ variants. Their sole purpose is instructing token viewers which external dependency to load at runtime.
:::

### **2.e.** Build instructions

::: info
This section only applies to non-browser-based renderers.
:::

The build of a locally executed token revolves around a Dockerfile that should be included in the files of the _renderer_ token. Optionally, package or configuration files can be included that are required by the Dockerfile to build the image.

```json
{
  "files": [{
    "name": "Dockerfile",
    "mediaType": "text/plain",
    "src": <array>
  }]
}
```

::: details
Token viewers will download all the files of a _renderer_ before building. It's up to the Dockerfile to grab the correct files from the build context.

Creators may also choose to embed everything inside the Dockerfile. There are no other conventions. As long as the container's entry point can be called with the arguments provided by the _scene_ token.
:::

### **2.f.** License types

For creators, it is recommended to choose a license that aligns with their values and with the purpose of the digital artifact. Any license can be used, but popular licenses are:

- [NFT License 2.0](https://www.nftlicense.org/)
- [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)
- [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
- [AGPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)

Using [no license](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/) is also an option to explicitly indicate that no one other than the creator may use the software.

## **3**. Dependency

This section applies to _onchain_ and _internal_ dependencies. Aside from how they are referenced, they are technically the same.

::: details
What sets them apart is the scope in which they are available and by whom they are managed.

- _onchain_: managed by creators, must be minted under the same `policy_id` as the _renderer_ token referencing them and only available within that policy
- _internal_: managed by token viewers and globally available to anyone using the DAT Metadata Standard
  :::

Dependency tokens can have multiple parts if they do not fit into one 16kB transaction. The dependency referenced from the _renderer_ serves as an entry point, referencing the additional parts.

::: warning
The number of accepted dependency parts is limited. Token viewers decide how many parts to allow or support. Ten parts should be more than sufficient in most scenarios.
:::

### **3.a.** Metadata

The code is stored in the **`files`** property as-is or as a base64-encoded string. The `name` property of the file must match the `asset_name`. Like the _renderer_, every file can have an individual `license` property.

```json{9,13-15}
{
  "721": {
    "<policy_id>": {
      "<asset_name>": {
        "files": [{
          "name": <asset_name>.<extension>,
          "mediaType": <mime_type>,
          "src": <uri | array>,
          "license": <string | null>,
          <other_properties>
        }],

        "parts": [
          <part_asset_name>
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Properties for the _dependency_ token:

- **`parts`** (_optional_): an array with asset names (e.g. `asset_name_part_2`)

::: info
While not mandatory, adding a **`license`** property to each file in the `files` section is advisableâ€”more info on licenses is in section 2.f.
:::

::: tip
Dependency tokens should be burned after minting to free up the UTxOs.
